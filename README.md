# Student-Database-System
Unlike other mini projects published in Code with C, this mini project in C Student Record System has a unique style of coding and is presented in a colorful manner.It iss my 1st sem project in C lang. It uses files as database to perform file handling operations such as add, search, modify and delete records to manage students’ records. In this project, you can also generate mark-sheet for students.  Here, a console window is virtually divided into 2 parts – one is static and it does not change, while the other is dynamic and it changes from time to time. The text are coded using various color-related functions to make them static.  The source code for this mini project is error-free, but not complete. There are many places for improvements and enhancements within the project. This C mini project on student record management system is compiled in Code::Blocks IDE using GCC compiler.  So, compiling the source codes in other platforms or compiler such as Turbo C will produce errors. The C code is around 400 lines.

Features of Student Record System in C:
Simple functions have been to manipulate data structure and file handling, so here I will just list the features of this project.

Add student record
Search student record
Modify student record
Delete student record
Change password
The functions listed below have been used to produce background with color effects. They are described in the source code with comments.

void SetColor(int ForgC)
void ClearConsoleToColors(int ForgC, int BackC)
void SetColorAndBackground(int ForgC, int BackC
void gotoxy (int x, int y) – I have been describing this function in most of the C projects published on this site. You need to understand this function as it is an important one used in this mini project on student record management system.

Note- This function allows you to print text in any place of screen. Using this function in Code::Blocks requires coding, but it can be directly used in Turbo C. Here is a code for this function in Code::Blocks.
